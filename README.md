# pvutils

An R package for executing disproportionality analyses with ic, prr and ror. Under development, but hope to release first version within the upcoming months. 

From a personal growth point of view, I started tinkering with this package after reading advanced R. I've learnt a lot about  metaprogramming, S3, cli, unit tests, function documentation and vignette writing.
