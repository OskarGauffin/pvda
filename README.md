# pvutils

An R package for executing disproportionality analyses with ic, prr and ror. Under development, but hope to release first version within the upcoming months. 

From a personal growth point of view, I started tinkering with this package after reading advanced R and I've learnt a lot about  metaprogramming, S3, and other package development bells and whistles, coloured console printouts, unit tests, continuous integration, proper function documentation and perhaps the most important piece, a helpful vignette.
