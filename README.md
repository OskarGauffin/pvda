# pvutils

An R package for executing disproportionality analyses with ic, prr and ror. Under development, but hope to release first version within the upcoming months. 

From a more personal point of view, this package has been a learning project for me where I've used dtplyr, tried some metaprogramming from advanced R, used S3 object orientation, and some other bells and whistles, coloured console printouts, unit tests, proper function documentation and a helpful vignette.
