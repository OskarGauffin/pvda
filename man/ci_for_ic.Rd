\usage{
ci_for_ic(obs, exp, sign_lvl_probs, shrinkage)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{A numeric vector with observed counts, i.e. number of reports
for the selected drug-event-combination.}

\item{exp}{A numeric vector with expected counts, i.e. number of reports
to be expected given a comparator or \emph{background}.}

\item{sign_lvl_probs}{The probabilities of the posterior, based on
a passed significance level (\code{sign_lvl}) in \code{\link{ic}}. For
instance, if \code{sgn_lvl = .95} in \code{ic} is used, quantiles will be
extracted at \code{sgn_lvl_probs} 0.025 and 0.975.}

\item{shrinkage}{A non-negative numeric of length 1, to be added to
observed and expected count. Default is 0.5.}
}
\description{
Mainly used in \code{link{ic}}. Produces quantiles of the
posterior gamma distribution. Called twice in \code{ic} to create a
credibility interval.
