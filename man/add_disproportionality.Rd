\title{Add disproportionality estimates to data frame
with expected counts}
\usage{
add_disproportionality(
  df = NULL,
  da_estimators = c("ic", "prr", "ror"),
  rule_of_N = 3,
  number_of_digits = 2,
  sign_lvl = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Intended use is on the output tibble from \code{add_expected_counts}.}

\item{da_estimators}{Character vector specifying which disproportionality
estimators to use, in case you don't need all implemented options. Defaults
to c("ic", "prr", "ror").}

\item{rule_of_N}{Numeric value. Sets estimates for ROR and PRR to NA when observed
counts are strictly less than the passed value of \code{rule_of_N}. Default value
is 3, 5 is sometimes used as a more liberal alternative. Set to NULL if you
don't want to apply any such rule.}

\item{number_of_digits}{Numeric value. Set the number of digits to show in output by passing
an integer. Default value is 2 digits. Set to NULL to avoid rounding.}

\item{sign_lvl}{Significance level of confidence or credibility intervals.
Default is 0.95 (i.e. 95 \% confidence interval)}
}
\value{
The passed data frame with disproportionality point and interval
estimates.
